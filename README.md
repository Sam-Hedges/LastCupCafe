- # RTSProject - Tragedy of the Commons Real-Time Strategy Game
## Overview

Welcome to the RTSProject, a real-time strategy (RTS) game that explores the concept of the "Tragedy of the Commons." This project aims to challenge players to make strategic decisions to maximize their profits while responsibly managing shared resources to avoid depletion.
### Proposed Concept: Tragedy of the Commons

The Tragedy of the Commons is a well-known concept in sustainability that examines how shared resources can be depleted when individuals act solely in their own self-interest. This project takes inspiration from this concept and aims to create an engaging and thought-provoking game that simulates the challenges of resource management within a competitive environment.
### Idea

In RTSProject, players will immerse themselves in a fast-paced, high-pressure strategy game that confronts them with the dilemma of achieving the highest profit without completely depleting the shared resources. Key features of the game include: 
- **Game Modes:**  Players can choose between single-player mode or local multiplayer mode for 2 to 6 players, allowing for competitive challenges. 
- **Resource Scenarios:**  The game can be based on the classic "fishing game" scenario or other real-world or imaginative scenarios that involve resource management. 
- **Success Metrics:**  Success can be measured by staying in profit for the longest duration or accumulating the highest amount in the bank by the end of a time-limited period. 
- **Multiple Levels:**  Players can explore different oceans, stations, or settings, each presenting unique challenges and resource management scenarios. 
- **Difficulty:**  The game should provide a challenging experience, making it hard to win and encouraging players to think strategically.
### Target Audience

RTSProject is designed to cater to a broad audience, primarily targeting ages 13 and above. It is particularly suitable for older teenagers and young adults, offering an entertaining and educational experience. This game can also serve as a valuable tool for educators at the degree level to engage students in discussions about resource management and sustainability.
## Project Goals

The primary goals of the RTSProject are as follows: 
1. Create an engaging and thought-provoking real-time strategy game that challenges players to balance profit-making and responsible resource management. 
2. Foster an understanding of the Tragedy of the Commons concept and its real-world implications. 
3. Offer an entertaining and educational gaming experience suitable for a wide range of audiences, with a focus on older teenagers and young adults. 
4. Provide an opportunity for local multiplayer competition, promoting social interaction and strategic thinking.
