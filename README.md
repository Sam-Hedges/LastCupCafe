# RTSProject - Tragedy of the Commons Real-Time Strategy Game
## Overview

Welcome to the RTSProject, a real-time strategy (RTS) game that explores the concept of the "Tragedy of the Commons." This project aims to challenge players to make strategic decisions to maximize their profits while responsibly managing shared resources to avoid depletion.

The Tragedy of the Commons is a well-known concept in sustainability that examines how shared resources can be depleted when individuals act solely in their own self-interest. This project takes inspiration from this concept and aims to create an engaging and thought-provoking game that simulates the challenges of resource management within a competitive environment.
